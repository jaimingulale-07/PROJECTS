## 🎲 The Project Lineup  
Here’s what’s spinning in the playground right now:

### 1. FPGA Image Compression  
📄 **[Report: fpga_report_22bec044.pdf](https://github.com/jaimingulale-07/PROJECTS/blob/main/fpga_report_22bec044.pdf)**  
- **What It’s About**: Squeezing images down to size using FPGA hardware—fast, efficient, awesome.  
- **Tech Stack**: FPGA (Verilog/VHDL), [add tools like Quartus if used].  
- **Status**: [![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-blue)]()  
*Check out the report for the full scoop on circuits and compression!*

### 2. MnM Simulation Demo  
🎥 **[Video: MnM simulation video (1).mp4](https://github.com/jaimingulale-07/PROJECTS/blob/main/MnM%20simulation%20video%20(1).mp4)**  
- **What It’s About**: A visual demo of a simulation—think moving parts, cool visuals, and tech in action.  
- **Tech Stack**: [e.g., Simulation software like MATLAB, Python, or custom tools—specify if known].  
- **Status**: [![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Demo%20Ready-brightgreen)]()  
*Download the MP4 to see it run—pairs with the MnM assignment below!*

### 3. Digital Logic Design Assignment  
📄 **[Report: SA -DLD.pdf](https://github.com/jaimingulale-07/PROJECTS/blob/main/SA%20-DLD.pdf)**  
- **What It’s About**: A deep dive into Digital Logic Design—gates, circuits, and all that binary goodness.  
- **Tech Stack**: [e.g., Logisim, Verilog, or pen-and-paper design—add what you used].  
- **Status**: [![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-blue)]()  
*Flip through the PDF for logic diagrams and solutions!*

### 4. MnM Special Assignment  
📄 **[Report: mnm special assignment.pdf](https://github.com/jaimingulale-07/PROJECTS/blob/main/mnm%20special%20assignment.pdf)**  
- **What It’s About**: The brains behind the MnM simulation—details, theory, and results.  
- **Tech Stack**: [e.g., Python, MATLAB, or related simulation tools—fill in specifics].  
- **Status**: [![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-blue)]()  
*Tied to the video above—read this to get the full story!*
